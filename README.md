The current issue is that
operations can do lots of differett things depending
on the circumstance
like 5 + 5 + = 10 + but
5 + + should equal 5 + but
5 + = should equal 10
5 + 5 = = should equal 15
5 + 5 + = should equal 20

Make it so if you keep hitting equals it will keep operating with the same second number to the total

Make it so you can only have 1 decimal
